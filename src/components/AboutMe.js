        My name is Luca and I currently reside in Denver, CO. I have been a pediatric nurse for over 8 years and I currently work at The Children's Hosptial of Colorado. 
        <br></br>
         I recently  made the decision to immerse myself in something that I have always been passionate about: web development.
